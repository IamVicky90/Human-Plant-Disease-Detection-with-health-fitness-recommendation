                        <h2>
                            What is Septoria Leaf Spot?
                        </h2>
                        Septoria leaf spot, also known as septoria blight is a common disease of the tomato plant, which also affects other members of the plant family Solanaceae, namely potatoes and eggplant. The disease is caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici, and is known to affect crops in different regions all around the world. The disease won’t always kill your tomato plants, but it can do some pretty severe damage to the crops, defoliating them, weakening them, and if not treated, Septoria leaf spot will take over the entire plant, keeping them from being able to produce mature fruit.

                        
                        <h2>
                            How to cure it?
                        </h2>
                        As soon as you see signs of Septoria leaf spot, take action, and remove all infected leaves immediately. Wash your hands thoroughly before continuing to work in the garden around uninfected plants. Clean and disinfect your pruning shears or scissors after removing infected leaves.
<br>
Organic fungicides can go a long way towards treating and preventing fungal infections like septoria leaf spot. Fungicides containing copper and potassium bicarbonate will help contain the fungal disease and keep it from spreading. Start spraying as soon as you notice symptoms of septoria leaf spot. Continue treating according to the directions on the fungicide label.
<br>
If organic fungicides aren’t standing up to the task, you may be forced to consider chemical control options. One of the most effective chemical fungicides is also one of the least toxic, the compound is called chlorothalonil, and it is sold under the names Fungonil and Daconil.
